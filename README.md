View the custom new tab page 
with google and youtube search bar
using simple javascripy!

How it works:
___________

the js file selects input from the html 
and the for ac click event or when enter key is pressed

as we know google search url is like this 'https://www.google.com/search?q=search%term'
so u take your value from input field when it is not empty and the make it like this

window.location(`https://ww.google.com/search?q=${your_value_here}`)

and it is the same logic for youtube

Thank you!!!!!
